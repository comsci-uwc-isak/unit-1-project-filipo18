**What skills have you developed so far?**
1. Coding in bash
1. To do my homework right after class
1. Think in computer logic - logicaly get the steps of my program that computer can uderstands
1. Debuging - finding my own mistakes
1. Documenting and explaing my every program

**What have worked for you in the classrom of CS?**
Try just to get everything that teachers says in class, try to understand every step, ask if I don't understand something and then finnsihing programs after school. I think it wokrs much better for me compare to just copying everything in class and try to understand everything at home.

**What are some things/activities/strategies that you would change in the CS classroom to achive your best in the next 6 weeks**
Class works perfect for me. I always prefered problem based learnig when I was faced with problem I need to solve and learn in the proces of problem solving. Working on theory from the begining and then try to apply it to problems is much harder for me, because without examples I don't have nothing to conect what I learned from theroy.

Today we were finnishing CarRentalApp, I just copied edit and delete and backup programs, so I need to test them and finnish documentation for them. I feel like I have situtation under control, backup, install and uninstall programs will maybe make me some problems becasue for user is complicated to enter correct path. For me is hard to guess whic path will be correct on users computer. I will try to work on that. Otherwise app is almost finnished. Tomorrow willl probably be complete than just testing seperates us from finnishing the project.
